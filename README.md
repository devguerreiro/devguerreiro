## Whatsup! ðŸ‘‹
I am a determined, proactive, ambitious person with a thirst for business success. I don't like sameness and complacency, that's why I'm always looking to evolve and grow as a person and professional, through courses, lectures, videos, and even advice from other people, because I like to positively impact the environments I'm in and to be part of something bigger, and that makes sense to me.

I'm a resilient person, even with technologies. I've worked with Python, Django, Django REST, FastAPI, Vue.js, React.js, React Native, Postgres, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Elastic APM, AWS Lambda, AWS SQS, AWS EC2, AWS S3, Pandas, Selenium, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Azure Pipeline... in addition to others such as Node.js, Astro.build, Kubernetes, Istio, for study purposes.
