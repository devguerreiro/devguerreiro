I work as a fullstack software engineer specializing in React, Next.js, NestJS, Django, and FastAPI, with a strong focus on technical project leadership, business vision, and continuous improvement. I have a knack for dealing directly with users and stakeholders, working both on delivering value and evolving internal processes. I come from an agile and startup background, which gives me the agility and adaptability to lead teams and build cutting-edge products.
