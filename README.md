I am a determined, proactive, ambitious, and extroverted person. I don't like sameness and complacency, so I'm always looking to evolve and grow as a person and professional, through courses, lectures, videos, and even advice from other people, as I like to make a positive impact on the environments I'm in and to be part of something bigger, and that makes sense to me.

I'm a resilient person, even with technologies. I've worked with Python, Django, Django REST, FastAPI, Vue.js, React.js, React Native, Postgres, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Elastic APM, AWS, Azure DevOps, Pandas, Selenium... as well as other technologies in personal/studies projects, such as Node.js, Express.js, Nuxt.js, Next.js, Astro.build, Kubernetes, Istio.
